== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this create new database tables? =

Yes. It creates a new `wp_termmeta` database table for each site it's activated on.

= Does this modify existing database tables? =

No. All of WordPress's core database tables remain untouched.

= How do I query for terms via metadata? =

With WordPress's `get_terms()` function, the same as usual, but with an additional `meta_query` argument according the `WP_Meta_Query` specification:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Meta_Query

`
$terms = get_terms( 'category', array(
        'depth'      => 1,
        'number'     => 100,
        'parent'     => 0,
        'orderby'    => 'order', // Try the "wp-term-order" plugin!
        'order'      => 'ASC',
        'hide_empty' => false,

        // Looky looky!
        'meta_query' => array( array(
                'key' => 'term_thumbnail'
        ) )
) );
