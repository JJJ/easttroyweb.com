A Free yet feature rich metadata plugin that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing and easier sharing of your content.

== Description ==

_Add-Meta-Tags_ is a Free metadata plugin for the _WordPress Publishing Platform_ that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing of your content by search engines and easier sharing on social networks. It achieves this by generating machine friendly information about your content, called <em>metadata</em>, according to widely used standard specifications.

<blockquote>

<strong>Notice about the current status and the future plans</strong>

<br /><br />

Please note that, since version 2.11.0, the developer does not provide support for this plugin on any support channel. If the <em>FAQ</em>, the <em>wiki</em> documentation and the integrated <em>help</em> in the plugin settings page are not enough for you, then, please consider using other plugins.

<br /><br />

Moreover, no new features or improvements of the current ones have been planned. The current feature set is already beyond what the developer needs or uses, so, due to lack of free time, further development and enhancement of the plugin is no longer in the developer's plans.

<br /><br />

However, the developer still uses this plugin, so, it will continue to receive maintenance updates, but only for critical issues, such as PHP errors or very important metadata issues. Thank you for your understanding.

<br /><br />

Also, please note that Add-Meta-Tags is not for sale.

<br /><br />

For more information, please read the FAQ.

More specifically, _Add-Meta-Tags_ can generate the _description_ and _keywords_ meta tags, _Opengraph_, _Schema.org_ microdata and JSON+LD data, _Twitter Cards_ and _Dublin Core_ metadata for your _WordPress_ content and archives, your _WooCommerce_ products and product groups, _BuddyPress_ profiles, and more.

It also supports advanced _title customization_ letting you take control of the title generation on every part of the web site. Moreover, a basic _breadcrumb trail_ generator is provided for use with hierarchical post types. Last, but not least, it lets you customize the _locale_ on a per post basis generating a proper `hreflang` link for a signle language and, also, is out-of-the-box compatible with _WPML_ and _Polylang_ multilingual plugins (through the WPML language configuration file that ships with the plugin). Finally, support for [Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://www.ampproject.org/) as generated by the _AMP_ plugin has been implemented.

Add-Meta-Tags supports internal caching of the generated metadata of content and media pages and thus contributes to the preservation of system resources on high traffic web sites. Metadata caching can also lead to slightly faster page load times in several cases.

Add-Meta-Tags was started in 2006. Please visit the [Add-Meta-Tags historical homepage](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/05/add-meta-tags-wordpress-plugin/).
