Add-Meta-Tags
=============

Add-Meta-Tags (AMT) is a Free open-source plugin for the WordPress Publishing
Platform that generates *metadata* for your content and WooCommerce products,
including the basic *description* and *keywords* meta tags, Opengraph, Schema.org,
Twitter Cards and Dublin Core metadata.

It also supports advanced *SEO title* customization letting you take control of
the title generation on every part of the web site. Moreover, a basic *breadcrumb
trail* generator is provided for use with hierarchical post types. Last, but not
least, it lets you customize the *locale* on a per post basis generating a proper
*hreflang* for a signle language and, also, is out-of-the-box compatible with
WPML and Polylang multilingual plugins (through the WPML language configuration
file that ships with the plugin).

Add-Meta-Tags is one of the personal software projects of George Notaras.
It is developed in his free time and released to the open source WordPress
community as Free software.
