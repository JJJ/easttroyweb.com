== Description ==

WP User Groups allows users to be categorized using custom taxonomies & terms.

* "Groups" & "Types" are created by default, and can be overridden
* More user group types can be registered with custom arguments
* Edit users and set their relationships
* Bulk edit many users to quickly assign several at once
* Filter the users list to see which users are in what groups
* Not destructive data storage (plugin can be enabled & disabled without damage)
* Works great with all WP Term Meta plugins (see below)
