== Description ==

WP User Activity is the best way to log activity in WordPress. Activity can be sorted, filtered, and viewed per-user, along with session data for logged in users and IP addresses & user-agents for others.

Activity is broken down into object "Types" and "Actions." Types are the objects being acted upon, and actions are what is being done to them. If you're familiar with BuddyPress, this should feel pretty comfortable.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with custom post types & taxonomies? =

Yes. It will work perfectly with all post-types & taxonomies that define their own labels. Ones that don't are mocked using the post type ID.

= Can I create custom activity types & actions? =

Yes. The autoloader can be filtered, so adding new object types is as simple as:

`
add_filter( 'wp_get_default_user_activity_types', function( $types = array() ) {
	$types[] = 'Your_New_Type' // class that extends WP_User_Activity_Type
} );
`

The `WP_User_Activity_Type_Taxonomy` class is a good example to start with, if you'd like to create your own actions. It registers simple create/update/delete methods, with easy to understand messages & integrations.

= Does this create new database tables? =

No. It uses WordPress's custom post-type and metadata APIs.

= Does this modify existing database tables? =

No. All of WordPress's core database tables remain untouched.

= Where can I get support? =

= Where can I find documentation? =
