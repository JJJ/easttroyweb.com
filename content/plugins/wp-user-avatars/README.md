# WP User Avatars

## Synopsis

A WordPress plugin to allow registered users to upload & select their own avatars.

## Screenshots

## Motivation

I decided to create this plugin because no existing solutions integrated into WordPress in a way that felt native to me. I also wanted something that more tightly integrated with my WP User Profiles plugin.

## Installation

* Download and install using the built in WordPress plugin installer.
* Activate in the "Plugins" area of your admin by clicking the "Activate" link.
* No further setup or configuration is necessary.
