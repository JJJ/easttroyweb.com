Editor comes with a few custom element styles, which are used to easily add extra styling to your WordPress posts.

** Pull Quotes **

Pull quotes are similar to block quotes, but are reserved for less text. See Editor’s Style Guide to see the suggested usage. To use pull quotes you can add a class of pull-left or pull-right to your content. See an example below.

<span class="pull-right">This text will be pulled right.</span>

** Text Highlight **

Text highlight simply adds a yellow background to your text, useful for in-paragraph emphasis. To use the highlight style, you can add a class of highlight to your content. See an example below.

<span class="highlight">This text will be highlighted.</span>
